# Hangman

Let's make our own version of the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Hangman</a> game that runs in the browser.

## UI Elements

* A button that starts the game

* A stick figure consisting of six segments (head, torso, two arms, and two legs) all of which are initially invisible

* A series of underscores that will be replaced with letters when correct guesses are made

* A series of crossed out letters representing incorrect guesses

* A form field for entering a single letter

* A button for submitting a guessed letter

* A button for solving the puzzle before guessing all the letters

* A form field for attempts to solve the puzzle (initially invisible - it appears when the user indicates she wants to guess the entire word)

* A message that appears when the user has won the game

* A message that appears when the user has lost the game

* A button that appears with the won/lost messages that allows the user to start a new game

For now let's use a list of words of your choosing that are each 6 to 12 letters long. When the game starts one word from the list should be selected at random.
