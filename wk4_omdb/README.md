You are working for a client who wants to make his movie theatre more “techy”, so the owner has hired you to build them a website. This is a special movie theatre that also has old movies playing as well as new ones. The purpose of this website will be to display movie information on a page.

1.	You will be using the IMDb open API, [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
2. 	For each search query, we are only displaying one result (using the "by title" query format).
3.	When the user types in an input field and hits "Submit", use AJAX and jQuery to populate the page with the following info:
	* Movie poster
	* Title
	* List of actors
	* Release date
	* Director
	* Any awards it won
4. When a user make a subsequent search, the page will remove the previous query results and display the new results.
5. The user should also be able to hit "Enter/Return" to initiate the search.

**Note**: Do not use `http-server` to view this page. Open it in your browser directly.
