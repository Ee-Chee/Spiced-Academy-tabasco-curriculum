# Edit Profile

In your <a href="../wk6_express">Express project</a> create a page on which users can edit the data we have stored for them.

* First name
* Last name
* Email address
* Password
* City
* Homepage URL
* Age
* Favorite color

When the page loads it should show all of the currently stored values in editable form fields with a submit button beneath them.

If you were doing your validations and queries in your routes, now would be a good time to refactor so you don't have to rewrite them in a different route!
