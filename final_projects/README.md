# Final Projects

The last week of this course is dedicated to final projects. You get to decide what you work on but there are a few guidelines you must follow.

Your project must be **substantial** - you want to end up with something you can proudly demo on graduation day and thereafter, a fitting capstone to your time at SPICED.

Your project must also be **achievable**. You do not want to end the week with little more than a good idea.

It is ok if your project is just the first phase of a much larger project that could not possibly be achieved in one week, but it still must be a coherent and presentable piece of work on its own.

It is also ok to work on teams, if you like, which should result in an even more substantial project.

This project is an opportunity to show what you have learned but it is also an opportunity to learn new things. It is expected that you will use things that we covered in class but you are welcome to try things with which you have no experience, provided that it seems reasonably certain that you will be able to accomplish your project's goals.

It would be great if you could deploy your project to [Heroku](../wk8_heroku) or otherwise make it available online but for many projects that will not be possible.

It is required that you create a repo for this project and you should commit to it frequently.

You should have already discussed your project with your friendly neighborhood faculty member. Please do so immediately if you haven't already.

If you are short on ideas, rest assured that there are [plenty out there](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas) to choose from.
