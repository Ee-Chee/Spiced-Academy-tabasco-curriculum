Create a mad-lib game using the **readline** module in node. The game should prompt the user for 3-5 different types of words (verb, noun, adjective, shape, color, etc.). 

* the game should prompt for input 1 question at a time.
* once you have all the inputs, you should concatenate together a funny mad-lib and display it on the command line.
* BONUS - use rl.on("close") event to deliver the madlib to the console and close out the CLI
